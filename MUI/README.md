# SAASR Frontend

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install orval and prettier globally:

```bash
npm i -g orval
npm i -g prettier
```

### Create api functions and models

Edit orval.config.js. Make sure api is up and running.

```bash
orval
```

The generated functions and hooks are in `MUI/src/saasrapi`. If you make changes to the API, you need to re-run `orval`.

### Run the app
