# SAASR

This repository contains a [FastAPI application](backend/README.md)backend and a [Reactjs frontend](frontend/README.md) that can be used as starter / template for a SAAS application.

Orval is integrated, so it reads the OpenAPI specs FastAPI generates, and creates Reactjs functions and hooks to use the API.

The API includes Users, Authorization, Authentication, teams, and payments through EasyPay.
